* cv2.approxPolyDP(curve, epsilon, closed)
curve: The input curve (contour) you want to approximate.

epsilon: A parameter that controls the approximation accuracy. Smaller values result in a more accurate approximation.
	Proportional to Perimeter:
			The cv2.arcLength(contour, True) perimeter ofcontour. when True means curve is closed 
			 1% of the contour's perimeter.

closed: A boolean flag that indicates whether the curve is a closed contour or not.

*Ravel
	This function is used to flatten a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array. 

*Heirarchy[Next, Previous, First_Child, Parent]

*RETR_LST
Parents and kids are equal under this rule, and they are just contours

*RETR_EXTERNAL
We can say, under this law, Only the eldest in every family is taken care of. It doesn't care about other members of the family 

*RETR_CCOMP
external contours of the object (ie its boundary) are placed in hierarchy-1. And the contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in hierarchy-2.

* RETR_TREE
It retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy list

*cv.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q')
This is done to extract the lowest 8 bits of the returned value
